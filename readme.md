# Hi!

If you have a public Google Spreadsheet you can visualize that data through a few different js libraries. Since the spreadsheet updates automatically, so will your visualizations. That's cool. 

# Pie Chart

Using [tabletop.js](http://builtbybalance.com/Tabletop/) you can feed [raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com/) the data it needs to make pie charts.

# Maps

Using [tabletop.js](http://builtbybalance.com/Tabletop/) you can feed [leaflet.js](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/) the data it needs to make maps.

# STATS

Using [tabletop.js](http://builtbybalance.com/Tabletop/) and [mustache.js](http://mustache.github.com/) you can create templates for you website that includes data from your spreadsheet.
