# Hi!

If you have a public Google Spreadsheet you can visualize that data through a few different js libraries. Since the spreadsheet updates automatically, so will your visualizations. That's cool. 

# Pie Chart

Using tabletop.js you can feed raphel.js the data it needs to make pie charts.

# Maps

Using tabletop.js you can feed leaflet the data it needs to make maps.

# STATS

Using tabletop.js and handlebars.js you can create templates for you website that includes data from your spreadsheet.
