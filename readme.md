# Hi!

If you have a public Google Spreadsheet you can visualize that data through a few different js libraries. Since the spreadsheet updates automatically, so will your visualizations. That's cool. 

You can view a working sample of the bits in action at [jllord.github.com/sheetsee.js/](http://jllord.github.com/sheetsee.js/)

## What's it all for?

I'm creating a bond referendum budget website for the City of Macon as a part of my [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org) fellowship. The site is built on Wordpress and will visualize the budget through the methods outlined here. The city's staff will be able to make changes to the budget through the linked Google spreadsheet. 

# Pie Chart

# Maps

Using [tabletop.js](http://builtbybalance.com/Tabletop/) you can feed [leaflet.js](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/) the data it needs to make maps.

# Stats

Using [tabletop.js](http://builtbybalance.com/Tabletop/) and [mustache.js](http://mustache.github.com/) you can create templates for you website that includes data from your spreadsheet.
