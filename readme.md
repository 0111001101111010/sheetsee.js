# Hello! 

This is the branch I'm building the changes to sheetsee.js on. Through a Knight-Mozilla Open News Grant I'll be making lots of improvements and working with WBEZ to make a sheetssee awesome. Newness will include: stripping it of all CfA project-specific idiosyncrasies and making it really easy to understand and stand up, more out of the box vizualization options, sortable tables of data, data caching and documentation galore!

Branches `gh-pages` and `master` will remain as-is for now until the new version is ready to roll.
