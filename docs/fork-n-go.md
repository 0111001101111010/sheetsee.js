# Fork-n-Go

A Fork-n-Go project is a project on GitHub that in a few clicks and starting with a fork, gives another user a live website that they control with an easy to swap-for-your-own Google Spreadsheet database.

To awesome things that make this possible: **Forking** and [**GitHub Pages**](http://pages.github.com).

On GitHub, a **fork** is a full copy of a repository, on your account, that you can manage and edit. It's done with the click of a button.

**GitHub Pages** is the hosting service that GitHub provides free to all users, organizations _and_ repositories. This means everyone of these entities or project can have it's own website at a predictable domain:

- **ORGS**: orgname.github.io
- **USER**: username.github.io
- **REPOSITORY**: username.github.io/repositoryname

To have a website for a repository all you need is a branch named `gh-pages`. GitHub will then look in that branch for web files and serve them up at the address.

What all of this means is that Sheetsee.js projects, hosted on gh-pages branches on GitHub, can easily be forked and connected to another spreadsheet giving another user a live website of their own really easily.
