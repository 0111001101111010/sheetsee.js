# Fork-n-Go

A Fork-n-Go project is a project on GitHub that in a few clicks and starting with a fork, gives you a live website that you control with an easy to swap-for-your-own Google Spreadsheet database.

To awesome things that make this possible: Forking and GitHub Pages.

On GitHub, a fork is a full copy of a repository that you can manage and edit. It's done with the click of a button.

GitHub Pages is the hosting service that GitHub provides free to all users, organizations _and_ repositories. This means everyone of these entities or project can have it's own website at a predictable domain:

ORGS: orgname.github.io
USER: username.github.io
REPOSITORY: username.github.io/repositoryname

To have a website for a repository all you need is a branch named `gh-pages`. GitHub will then look in that branch for web files and serve them up at the address.

What all of this means sheetsee projects, hosted on gh-pages branches on GitHub can easily be forked and connected to your spreadsheet giving you a live website really easily.

I think this is really exciting because I can imagine a world of these types of sites as templates.
